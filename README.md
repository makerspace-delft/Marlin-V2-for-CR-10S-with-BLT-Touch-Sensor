# Marlin-V2-for-CR-10S-with-BLT-Touch-Sensor

This is the repository with the exact Marlin V2 software used to run on the CR-10S in the makerspace. To upload this onto the printer, please use VS Code and the Platformio plug in.

In VS Code, open the Marlin-2.0.x-cr10sBLT folder. Then in VS Code, navigate to Marlin and then Configuration.h. When opened, at the bottom of the screen there should be a build option. After the build is done, connect the laptop to the 3D printer with a USB cable and then push onto the board. This should put the software on it.

# DISCLAIMER

This software package is configured for the specific printer setup and use case at Makerspace Delft. We do not recommend to use this distribution for another printer as compatibility cannot be guaranteed. Makerspace Delft is not liable for any damages inflicted.
