# Marlin-V2-for-CR-10S-with-BLT-Touch-Sensor

This is the repository with the exact Marlin V2 software used to run on the CR-10S in the makerspace. To upload this onto the printer, please use VS Code and the Platformio plug in.

In VS Code, open the Marlin-2.0.x-cr10sBLT folder. Then in VS Code, navigate to Marlin and then Configuration.h. When opened, at the bottom of the screen there should be a build option. After the build is done, connect the laptop to the 3D printer with a USB cable and then push onto the board. This should put the software on it.
